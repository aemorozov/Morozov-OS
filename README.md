Update January 05 2025. Version 1.1.4

# Morozov OS, offline Snake and GPT Assistant

Hello, after few months of work I am ready to present my website. This is not the first update, but this update is really important for me - I added interactive Assistant with Chat GPT API. But let’s start from the scratch.

New version of the Morozov OS includes:

⁃ **Readme.md** is apps descriptions.

⁃ **QR generator** - this is an app for business. You can generate a lot of unique QRs for your task in two clicks. This app can be useful for events or special tasks, when you need unique IDs for people or things. First step is data.xls creation with data for import into your systems. Second step is PDF creation with QRs for printing on the A4 size paper. QR generator uses your browser only and doesn’t use any backend, your data is not being sent anywhere and is not being saved anywhere.

⁃ **Snake web game** is my first app on Vanilla JS. It is really old app, but it is cool and fun. Sometimes I like to play it. I ported it to my website one of the first ones. If you don’t have the internet now but have opened the site, you can play it offline.

⁃ **FormToTelegram** - real contact form on my website. This form is helpful for business using the Telegram for the tasks. You can get customer requests to the Telegram without other apps and absolutely free! Only Telegram API and your website. Like PHPmailer, but with Telegram, if your remember PHPmailer. :)

⁃ **GPT Assistant** - OpenAI API + Backend + Web Chat is the best solution for the business which uses “online chat with sales manager”. I can create frontend, where you can ask and get answers, create backend with information about your company (like prompt) and add OpenIA API for the talk with Chat GPT. You can try it for free, ask what do you want, get the answer and some information about me. I created backend prompt about me and some instructions for the answers. It will try to sell myself like developer, but it can try to sell anything from online course to airplane.

I will try to release updates for my website and add some cool useful apps. If you have any questions, you can ask me from FormToTelegram or use LinkedIn.
